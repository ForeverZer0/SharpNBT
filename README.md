A fast and CLS-compliant implementation of the Named Binary Tag (NBT) specifications (Java/Bedrock) written in pure C#.

## Features

* **Java/Bedrock Support:** Supports all NBT protocols used by different versions of Minecraft, including: Java, Bedrock (file protocol), and Bedrock (network protocol), including full support for either GZip/ZLib compression, big/little endian, and variable length integers with optional ZigZag encoding.
* **Ease-of-use:** An intuitive API design, following the style and conventions of the .NET runtime, with full Intellisense for every member: Spend more time being productive and less time digging through documentation.
* **Performance:**  Leverages the power of modern C# language features to squeeze the fastest speeds and lowest memory footprint out of every operation, making it an ideal choice for use in game-development, when every spare nanosecond matters.
* **Concurrency:** Includes standard async/await concurrency patterns for reading and writing.
* **Cross-language support:** Fully CLR compliant, allowing support for any CLR language (i.e. C#, Visual Basic, F#, etc.) targeting the .NET runtime.
* **Callbacks:** Can subscribe to events that get a callback as the parser steps through a stream to get immediate feedback without waiting for document completion. This allows subscribers to even parse the payload themselves and handle the event entirely.
* **Stringified NBT**: Supports both generating and parsing arbitrary Stringified-NBT (SNBT) strings.

## Usage

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/ForeverZer0/SharpNBT/wiki) for more detailed explanations. Feel free to improve it by contributing!

### Reading

At its simplest, reading an NBT document is one-liner:

```csharp
CompoundTag tag = NbtFile.Read("/path/to/file.nbt", FormatOptions.Java, CompressionType.AutoDetect);
```
### Writing

Likewise writing a completed NBT tag is a one-liner:
```csharp
// Assuming "tag" is a valid variable
NbtFile.Write("/path/to/file.nbt", tag, FormatOptions.BedrockFile, CompressionType.ZLib);
```

### Viewing

While there is functionality to output NBT to other human-readable formats like JSON, if you simply need to visualize a tag, there is a custom "pretty printed" output you can use:

[bigtest.nbt](https://raw.github.com/Dav1dde/nbd/master/test/bigtest.nbt) from https://wiki.vg/

```csharp

var tag = NbtFile.Read("bigtest.nbt", FormatOptions.Java, CompressionType.GZip);
Console.WriteLine(tag.PrettyPrinted())
```
