# Conduct Yourself However You Want Code of Conduct

## This project is:

* An open-source code repository to share code and track issues

## This project is **NOT**:

* Social media
* Your moral guide
* Your parents
* Your priest
* A pulpit from which to preach or enforce virtue upon others

## Summary

GitHub Insights nags if this file does not exist, so here it is. I outright reject the philosophy behind the very idea for its existence.  

Treat others with respect, and expect the same return. This how human society works, it does not need outlined here using buzzwords like "safe" and "inclusive". I have no idea how a code repository could be "dangerous", but I can make the guaranteed that no one has ever been harmed by one if that helps you feel "safe".
